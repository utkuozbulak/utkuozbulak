# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Utku Ozbulak

I'm a **Research Professor at [Ghent University Global Campus (GUGC)](https://www.ghent.ac.kr/)** and an **Adjunct Professor at [George Mason University Korea (GMUK)](https://masonkorea.gmu.edu/)**.  Currently teaching Data Visualization at GMUK and Bioinformatics at GUGC.

These days I'm working on **trustworthy AI**, **medical & biomedical imaging**, and **AI for pharmaceutical sciences**. I'm also interested in surgical video understanding and the some strange properties of vision transformers (tokens and such).

If you are working on related topics -- especially pharmaceutical applications -- and are looking for someone with strong **coding**, **visualization**, and **AI** experience, feel free to reach out.
